# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started GitHub account, began <html> on Free Code Camp

**Thoughts**: Free Code Camp was pretty cool. The tutorials are always fun, and a decent way to learn things I believe. But, it's always way easier when someone/something is there to hold your hand. I need to finish the barebone <html> section and then make my own project to truly learn. Really wanted to get back into CodeWars while I was running through that. I may start the CodeWars for <html>. Gotta up that KATA!

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com) No work but I left this in there as an example so I know how to link on GitHub "files"
