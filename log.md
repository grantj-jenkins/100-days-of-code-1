# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started GitHub account, began <html> on Free Code Camp

**Thoughts**: Free Code Camp was pretty cool. The tutorials are always fun, and a decent way to learn things I believe. But, it's always way easier when someone/something is there to hold your hand. I need to finish the barebone <html> section and then make my own project to truly learn. Really wanted to get back into CodeWars while I was running through that. I may start the CodeWars for <html>. Gotta up that KATA!

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com) No work but I left this in there as an example so I know how to link on GitHub "files"

**Today's Progress**: Going back to Python for a bit, starting the Shortest Knight Path Problem. Began planning/reading up on Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Thoughts**: I didn't write any code today, but I think that is part of the process. I completely forgot about Dijkstra's and now I'm really wishing I paid more attention in my Graph Theory class. Or maybe, that I was just better at Graph Theory. *Side note, there is no CodeWars for <html> unfortnately*. I am starting to see how the algorithm works though, just as a picture in my head. I am trying to express the chess board for graph/coding purposes. We will see...
